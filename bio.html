                           I am a person that really like to doing computer things like computer games and watch tournaments of professionals. As well I am an avid Dungeon and dragon, DND, player and it is one of my favorite things of all time it is one of the things that i do the most often of. My favorite part of DND is that you are not bound to anything and you can do anything and everything you want as long as it was within the rule and you are prepared to face the consequences. Overall thing I truly love is the story building of DND because it is like your very own fantasy novel that you help forge and create and your actions can have massive actions on the world and those you save thank you while those you don't save are gone forever or hold a grudge. as well I really love anime because my older sister would always show it to me.
